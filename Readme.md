# Parallax Module

Prestashop 1.7.* module

This module creates a parallax effect on the homepage of your shop.


The content of the text within the parallax effect is managed with a TinyMCE field which gives you the possibility to add any custom HTML code.


From the back-office, you can manage the customization of the effect such as the background image, the color of the title, the size of the title, etc...


Also, there is the option to modify or add any CSS and/or JS in order to custom your parallax effect.
